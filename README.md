# Low Level Programming - Holberton School

This repository contains programs written in C as part of the low-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. The projects cover various fundamental concepts of computer science and software engineering, including:

- Variables, if, else, while
- Functions and nested loops
- Pointers, arrays, and strings
- Recursion
- Static libraries: https://github.com/Amedjnoun/holbertonschool-low_level_programming
- Memory allocation and linked lists
- File I/O

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the repository, clone it using git:
